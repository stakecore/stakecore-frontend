    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    Songbird Systems Protocol (SSP) is a protocol consisting of three parts -
    STSO (Songbird Time Series Oracle), Fast Updates, and SDC (Songbird Data Connector).
    Rewards are distributed based on the delegated provider's performance in each 3.5-day epoch.
    We show statistics for the last 25 reward epochs. Note that a reward epoch on the Songbird Canary Network
    lasts 3.5 days.

    Note that Songbird is an economic testnet for the Flare Network and is therefore less secure,
    because tests for applications run on Songbird before they are launched on Flare.
