    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    Flare Systems Protocol is a protocol consisting of three parts -
    FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle), Fast Updates, and FDC (Flare Data Connector).
    Rewards are distributed based on the delegated provider's performance in each 3.5-day epoch.
    We show statistics for the last 25 reward epochs. Note that a reward epoch on Flare Network
    lasts 3.5 days.
